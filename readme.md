# PHP Performance Benchmarks

## Background
The simple benchmarks was a realization from [Thiemo MÃ¤ttig](http://maettig.com/) in 2012.
He writes: Please note that these are micro benchmarks. Micro benchmarks are stupid. I created this comparison to learn something about PHP and how the PHP compiler works. This can not be used to compare PHP versions or servers.

Now in 2015 is the simple benchmark also useful for me to learn about default PHP functions and his performance on different PHP server version. I create this repository to share the result and maybe other users can also use the static results in a html file, see the folder for each PHP version. Also would be nice, if other developers have ideas or pull request to the source for the results. The source is based in the original from the author, but I have formatted the source and solve the notices and warnings for a fast performance check.
